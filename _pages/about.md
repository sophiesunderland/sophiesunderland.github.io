      I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University. 
      I am also a research assistant for the Analysis Unit at Afrobarometer. Before joining MSU, 
      I earned both my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from the University of Florida, with minors 
      in Latin American and African Studies.

      My research focuses on political parties and the dynamics of political competition both within 
      and between parties. I am also interested in understanding party strategies and behavior outside 
      of election periods, which I refer to as the “off-season.” My regional specialization is Sub-Saharan 
      Africa, where I have conducted fieldwork in Angola, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Botswana.
