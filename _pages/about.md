I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University. I am also a research assistant for the Analysis Unit at Afrobarometer. Before joining MSU, I earned both my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from the University of Florida, with minors in Latin American and African Studies.  

My research focuses on political parties and the dynamics of political competition both within and between parties. I am also interested in understanding party strategies and behavior outside of election periods, which I refer to as the “off-season.” My regional specialization is Sub-Saharan Africa, where I have conducted fieldwork in Angola, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Botswana.
