I'm a PhD student in Political Science at Michigan State University. My research interests include political parties and how they organize at the subnational level, both during and outside of electoral periods, with a regional focus on Africa.

Prior to starting at MSU, I earned both my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science at the University of Florida, with minors in Latin American and African Studies.
