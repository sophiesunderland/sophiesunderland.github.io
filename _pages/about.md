I'm a current PhD student in Political Science at Michigan State University. I study political parties and how they behave, both during and outside of electoral periods. I also have an interest in political party organizations at the subnational level. My regional focus is on Sub-Saharan Africa. I have completed fieldwork in Angola, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Bostwana. Prior to beginning at MSU, I earned my BA and MA in Political Science at the University of Florida, with minors in Latin American and African Studies.
